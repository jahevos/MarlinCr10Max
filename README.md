# MarlinCr10Max
Trying to set up a Cr10Max w/Creality 4.2.7 and smaller printing plate and BLTouch

I was approached by someone who owns a CR10Max rescued 3d Printer with an odd setup of bedsize 400x400, BLTouch, the ST12864 Display and a Creality 4.2.7 Silent board.
Out of curiosity I agreed to looking into FW compiling, something I have only touched on the surface for the Chiron that i had owned at that time. 
WHoever wants to participate is more than welcome to add their grain of salt.

Firmware.bin and Config are right here.
